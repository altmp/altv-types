# Before Creating a Resource

In order to make programming easier. It is highly recommended to change a file explorer setting that hides the extensions of file types. In your Windows search bar type `File Explorer Options` and open the first link. **UNCHECK** `hide extensions for known file types` in the `View` tab.

# Creating a Resource

Simply create a folder inside the `resources` folder and call it whatever you want. In this bootcamp we will be calling it `example`.

Your folder structure should look similar to this:

```sh
│   altv-server.exe
│   server.cfg
│   package.json # Generated with 'npm init' in cmd line.
│                # See previous tutorial for more info.
├───data/
├───modules/
└───resources/
    └───example/ # We created this folder.
```

Create two more folders inside of `example` called `client` and `server`. Then inside of the `example` folder you will want to create a file called `resource.cfg`. You can do this by using the context menu or VSCode to create your file. Create a text file and rename the extension to `.cfg`. Example being `resource.txt -> resource.cfg`.

_This can be done for all file types in the future._

```sh
│   altv-server.exe
│   server.cfg
│   package.json
├───data/
├───modules/
└───resources/
    └───example/
        ├───server/ # We created this folder.
        ├───client/ # We created this folder.
        └───resource.cfg # We created this file.
```

Great! Now let's open `resource.cfg` and we'll add information about the `resource` we are creating.

```sh
# We are making a file called `resource.cfg` and adding the text below.
```

```
type: 'js',
main: server/startup.js,
client-main: client/startup.js,
client-files: [
	client/*
],
deps: []
```

Now we can add the last files that we need which are `server/startup.js` and `client/startup.js`.

Here's how your directory should look:

```sh
│   altv-server.exe
│   server.cfg
│   package.json
├───data/
├───modules/
└───resources/
    └───example/
        ├───server/
        │    └───startup.js # We created this file.
        ├───client/
        │    └───startup.js # We created this file.
        └───resource.cfg
```

Inside of `server/startup.js` you will want to put the following inside.

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-server" />
import * as alt from 'alt-server';

alt.log('Hello from server');
```

Inside of `client/startup.js` you will want to put the following inside.

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-client" />
/// <reference types="@altv/types-natives" />
import * as alt from 'alt-client';
import * as native from 'natives';

alt.log('Hello from client'); // Only visible in 'F8' menu.
```

# Open the Whole Folder in VSCode

Before we go any further it's important that you open the entire folder structure in VSCode.

`File -> Open Folder` and then open the folder where you have `altv-server` located. This will install all the necessary types needed to work with alt:V as well as configure your `package.json` a little bit further.

However, if you wish to perform this step manually that is no problem.

Simply run these commands in the root of your folder where `package.json` is located in a `terminal`, `powershell`, or `cmd`.

```sh
npm i @altv/types-client --save-dev
npm i @altv/types-server --save-dev
npm i @altv/types-natives --save-dev
npm i @altv/types-webview --save-dev
npm i @altv/types-shared --save-dev
```

Your `package.json` should look similar this:

```
{
	"name": "test",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	},
	"author": "",
	"license": "ISC",
	"type": "module",
	"devDependencies": {
		"@altv/types-client": "latest",
		"@altv/types-natives": "latest",
		"@altv/types-server": "latest",
		"@altv/types-webview": "latest",
        "@altv/types-shared": "latest"
	}
}
```

_If you wish to re-install dependencies you should run just `npm install`._

        </a>
    </div>
</div>
