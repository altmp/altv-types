## CDN Links

CDN stands for content delivery network. It's just a fancy way to say a web host that is entirely dedicated to letting you download files from it. It has really high download speeds and can handle huge amounts of traffic.

You can grab the exact files you need from [https://wiki.altv.mp/wiki/Scripting:CDN_Links](https://wiki.altv.mp/wiki/Scripting:CDN_Links).

## altv-pkg

This is an alternative command line tool that will download and install everything you need. If you want a better understanding of what you are downloading it is highly recommended you setup your server manually. Check out [altv-pkg here](https://github.com/Stuyk/altv-pkg).
