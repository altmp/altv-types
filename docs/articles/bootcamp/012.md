# How to Install the Chat Resource

When you're working with alt:V it does not have a built-in chat interface so you must install a third-party chat. Luckily alt:V does provide on in the example resources you download from the website.

We're going to install that chat resource and work with it.

Go to the [official alt:V download page and tick resources](https://altv.mp/#/downloads)

## Moving and Renaming Files

The chat resource is a little old so we're going to actually move and rename some of the files from the `.zip`. As well as make some general updates.

_Move `index.mjs` to `server` folder and rename to `chat.js`_

_Move `client.js` and the folder `html` to the `client` folder and rename `client.js` to `chat.js`_

<br />
<br />

## Import inside Startup

We're going to need to import the `chat` file on both the `server-side` and `client-side`. Each folder has their own respective `chat` file to import. This can be done by editing the `startup.js` file for each folder and the doing a simple import. See the reference image below to see if your file structure is correct.

**Client Side**

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-client" />
/// <reference types="@altv/types-natives" />
import * as alt from 'alt-client';
import * as native from 'natives';
import './chat';

alt.log('Hello from client');
```

We'll need to make some additional changes to `client-side` code because the `chat` resource is slightly out of date.

Open `chat.js` in the `client` folder.

Change the following line:

```js
let view = new alt.WebView('http://resources/chat/html/index.html');
```

To

```js
let view = new alt.WebView('http://resource/client/html/index.html');
```

**Server Side**

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-server" />
import * as alt from 'alt-server';
import chat from './chat';

alt.log('Hello from server');
alt.on('playerConnect', handleConnect);
```

We'll also need to make an additional change to `server-side` code for the `chat` resource. This is to enable better handling of arguments on the recieving end when we are writing our commands.

Open `chat.js` in the `server` folder.

Change the following line:

```js
callback(player, args);
```

To:

```js
callback(player, ...args);
```

_The above change enables better handling of arguments._

## Test the Resource

That should be about it for adding `chat` to your resource. You can verify that `chat` is working correctly by joining your game and seeing if it loads and typing a few messages.

You should see the following in the top left corner of your game when you join.

Press `T` to chat and `ENTER` to send a message.

Now we can work with commands!
