# Adding a Resource to your Server

So, you've created your first resource! Now you need to tell the server to load it. You can do this by opening your `server.cfg`

```sh
name: "TestServer",
host: "0.0.0.0", # Leave this alone. 4 0's binds to ANY IP ADDRESS.
port: 7788,
players: 1024,
#password: "verysecurepassword",
announce: false,
#token: no-token,
gamemode: "Freeroam",
website: "test.com",
language: "en",
description: "test",
debug: true, # Make sure this is set to true.
modules: [
  "js-module",
],
resources: [
  example # We put the name of our resouce we created here
],
tags: ["Freeroam"],
```

Inside of `resources: []` we put the name of our resource, which we created in the [previous article](./006.md). We used `example` so will put that in above.

_The name needs to match what your called your resource or it will not work!_

# Turn on Debug Mode

If you are developing your server you will always want to turn on debug mode inside of your `server.cfg`. This can be done by adding `debug: true` to your `server.cfg`. You may see an example of this in the above code block.

# Verifiying the Resource Loaded

We now need to check the resource loaded correctly. We can do this by simply running the server as explained [here](./004.md).

The console in the image above outputted `Hello from server`, this confirms to us that the server has loaded the resource correctly and the resource is working as it should.

_If the console did not output anything, retry the previous step and try again!_

# Connecting

You can connect to your server at any time by opening alt:V and then putting in `127.0.0.1:7788` to connect to your local server. `127.0.0.1` means `localhost` for most computers. `7788` is the default port for alt:V Servers.
