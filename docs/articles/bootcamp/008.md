# Understanding Javascript

Well. We're not here to teach you how to code in Javascript. This is something that you need to do on your own time. However, we'll at the very least link a few videos for you to check out to help you get a better understanding of Javascript.

[JavaScript in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-I5S_zTwAc)

[JavaScript in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vReDflV-_yU)

_It is highly recommended that you physically follow along with these videos._

# Understanding VSCode

Now inside of VSCode you should see your entire file library on the left-hand side and should see two different `startup.js` files. We'll be working mainly in the `server` file as this controls what happens to a player.

## Using Intellisense

Open `server/startup.js` and take a look at the code block you wrote earlier in this tutorial.

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-server" />
import * as alt from 'alt-server';

alt.log('Hello from server');
```

Start by typing `alt.on` anywhere below the `imports`.

_You should see an auto-completion box with information_

As you can see you will see a handful of icons, text, and information. However, if you are a new developer none of this will make any sense to you. I'd like you to refer to the image below to help you understand what is going on a bit better.

## Functions

If you are new to development and you do not know what a function is. They are very simple and easy to understand. `Functions` are what we call to `execute a block of code`. `Functions` may also `take` what we call `parameters`.

```js
function sayHello() {
    alt.log('I am saying hello');
}

sayHello(); // This executes the above function.
```

```js
function sayMyName(someName, someAge, someHairColor) {
    alt.log(someName);
    alt.log(someAge);
    alt.log(`Hair Color is: ${someHairColor}`); // String Interpolation
}

sayMyName('stuyk', 27, 'Brown');
```

## Properties

`Properties` are single variables that can have their values `read` or `set`. However, this is dependent on the property.

```js
alt.log(alt.globalDimension); // This is reading the alt.globalDimension prop.
```

```js
alt.globalDimension = 5; // This is setting the alt.globalDimension prop.
```

## Classes

A `class` almost always starts with `new`. Classes are basically an `object` with a bunch of `functions` and `properties` that are accessible from within the class. A `Player`, `Vehicle`, `ColShape`, etc. are all classes.

```js
const vehicle = new alt.Vehicle('infernus', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
```

## Enums

Enums are mostly unique to `TypeScript` but we can leverage those types in Javascript by extracting values from there. When you type something like `alt.ExplosionType.Barrel` you can hover over it to get the value that it's meant to be. In this case it's `27`.
