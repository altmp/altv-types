# How to Write Chat Commands

The last page talks about installing the default chat resource that comes with alt:V in the `resources` folder when you download the binaries from the website.

In this section we're going to cover how to write basic chat commands for something like spawning the player, adding a vehicle, etc.

**Remember to change the individual files for the chat resource to allow better handling of commands.**

## Command Syntax

Almost all chat resources have a similar format where they require a `callback` function to execute your command.

Let's take a look at what that looks like.

```js
chat.registerCmd('test', (player) => {
    console.log('hello world');
});
```

When a player types `/test` in-game. Your server console will print `hello world`. What is happening in the function above is that a `player` instance is being passed back from

## Writing Positions to Chat

A utility that a lot of people usually need is to get the position of the player. Here's how we can do that and print that to chat.

```js
chat.registerCmd('pos', (player) => {
    chat.send(player, `${JSON.stringify(player.pos)}`);
    console.log(player.pos);
});
```

_If you want to print these positions to the local player's console you can add a console.log for messages on client-side._

## Writing a Vehicle Spawner

Below is some provided code to spawn a vehicle when you type `/vehicle infernus` in-game. It will spawn the vehicle model known as infernus in the game and place it right on top of the player.

_Sorry if your player dies doing this._

```js
chat.registerCmd('vehicle', (player, modelName) => {
    if (!modelName) {
        chat.send(player, `/vehicle [modelName]`);
        return;
    }

    let vehicle;

    try {
        vehicle = new alt.Vehicle(modelName, player.pos.x, player.pos.y, player.pos.z, 0, 0, 0);
    } catch (err) {
        chat.send(player, `~r~Invalid vehicle model.`);
        return;
    }
});
```

## Spawn the Player with a Command

You can assign a player model or use a default player using this simple command. In most cases servers won't require you to spawn the player so this could be seen as a change model command as well.

```js
chat.registerCmd('spawn', (player, modelName) => {
    if (!modelName) {
        modelName = 'mp_m_freemode_01';
    }

    player.spawn(player.pos.x, player.pos.y, player.pos.z, 0);

    try {
        player.model = modelName;
    } catch (err) {
        player.send(player, 'Invalid Model. Using default.');
        player.model = 'mp_m_freemode_01';
    }
});
```

## Excercises

Try solving these problems based on their vague descriptions to get more familiar with the alt:V API.

-   Only allow spawning 1 vehicle per player.
-   Set player health / armour.
-   Command to respawn the player after death.
-   Teleport the player somewhere else.
-   Teleport the player using arguments from chat.
-   Destroy the vehicle you are inside of.
-   Command to start / stop vehicle engine.
