# How to Spawn a Vehicle

Spawning a vehicle can be done by creating a new vehicle through the `alt.Vehicle` class. This should be done on `server-side` as this makes the vehicle accessible to all players and makes it visible for all players as well.

You should **NEVER** use natives to spawn vehicles unless it's for `client-side` only previewing or non-synchronized purposes.

## Base Example

Below is a base function to create a simple vehicle based on `player` position and vehicle `model`.

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-server" />
import * as alt from 'alt-server';

export function createVehicle(player, vehicleModel) {
    let vehicle;

    try {
        vehicle = new alt.Vehicle(vehicleModel, player.pos.x, player.pos.y, player.pos.z, 0, 0, 0);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(`${vehicleModel} does not exist.`);
        throw err;
    }

    if (!vehicle) {
        console.error(`${vehicleModel} does not exist.`);
        return;
    }

    console.log('Spawned a vehicle');
    return vehicle;
}
```

## Example Usage

Now depending on what is available in your server there are a ton of different ways to spawn a vehicle for a player. You can do it when they connect, when they die, when they type a command, etc. However, if you wish to do this by command you are going to need to install a `chat` resource as `alt:V` does not automatically come with a chat.

Below we will give the player a vehicle when they join the server.

```js
alt.on('playerConnect', (player) => {
    const spawnedVehicle = createVehicle(player, 'infernus');

    if (!spawnedVehicle) {
        console.error('Vehicle could not be spawned.');
        return;
    }
});
```

A vehicle will likely spawn on top of the player and crush them, but hey at least you got a vehicle spawned.
