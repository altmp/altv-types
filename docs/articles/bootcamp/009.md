# Spawning the Player

alt:V works in an event driven manner. Which means that something must happen from an event before anything can happen. There will always be a `cause` but you are mostly responsible for writing the `effect`.

With that in mind, let's take a look at `playerConnect`.

Because `alt.on` is a `function` we are going to execute that function from the main file. Anything that is written in your base file outside of a `function` will automatically execute. This is why `alt.log` shows `Hello from server` in your console automatically.

Let's add the `playerConnect` event. Type out `alt.on('playerConnect')` and you will see some information popup about what it's expecting.

It is looking for something called a `listener` and it has one single `parameter` called `player` with a type of `alt.Player`. This means it's going to send us a `player` when a player connects to the server.

## Fat Arrow Example

Alow known as lambda, anonymous, or closure functions.

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-server" />
import * as alt from 'alt-server';

alt.log('Hello from server');
alt.on('playerConnect', (player) => {
    // Do something to the player.
});
```

_This is one of many ways to handle an event. This uses a fat arrow function to create a new function inside of `alt.on`._

## Traditional Function Example

Here's an `alternative way` to write the above connection string.

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-server" />
import * as alt from 'alt-server';

alt.log('Hello from server');
alt.on('playerConnect', handleConnect);

/**
 * @param {alt.Player} player
 */
function handleConnect(player) {
    // Do something to the player.
}
```

_This uses a normal function with a type definition in @param to help give auto-completion inside of our new function._

## Which is Better?

Both are completely fine and valid in JavaScript. The document writer prefers the traditional method for the sake of readability and understanding code.

## Add the Spawn Code

In order to spawn the `player` we need to modify the `player` we recieved from the `event`. Simply type `player.spawn` and you'll see that it is a `function` and that it needs additional parameters. Here is what we ended up with in the `server/startup.js` file.

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-server" />
import * as alt from 'alt-server';

alt.log('Hello from server');
alt.on('playerConnect', handleConnect);

/**
 * @param {alt.Player} player
 */
function handleConnect(player) {
    // x, y, z, delay in ms
    player.spawn(-1291.71, 83.43, 54.89, 1000); // Spawns after 1 second.
}
```

## Add the Model Code

By default alt:V does not automatically spawn or give the player a model when they join the game. It's important to give them at least one of the two customizable models for GTA:Online when they join. Those models are `mp_m_freemode_01` and `mp_f_freemode_01`. They can be assigned to the `.model` parameter of a `player`.

```js
/// <reference types="@altv/types-server" />
import * as alt from 'alt-server';

alt.log('Hello from server');
alt.on('playerConnect', handleConnect);

/**
 * @param {alt.Player} player
 */
function handleConnect(player) {
    player.spawn(-1291.71, 83.43, 54.89, 1000); // Spawns after 1 second.
    player.model = `mp_m_freemode_01`;
}
```

Bootup your server from the command line, join or reconnect. Then see what happens. You should be spawned into the world and you will be free to move around.
